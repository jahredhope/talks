# CSS Between the Pages

These are the slides for [Phil Nash's](https://philna.sh/) talk CSS Between the Pages.

## > [The slides](https://philnash.github.io/talks/css-between-the-pages/slide-1/) <

Note that the slides are based on the multi-page view transitions. To see the slides with all the transitions you will need to view the slides in a browser that supports the API. At the time of writing, that is Chrome with the view transitions flag enabled as described on [slide 29](https://philnash.github.io/talks/css-between-the-pages/slide-29/).
